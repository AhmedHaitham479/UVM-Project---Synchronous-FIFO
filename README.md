# UVM-Project---Synchronous-FIFO
In This project I am tasked with verifying the functionality of a FIFO verilog design code. This was accomplished through the use of multiple packages and classes responsible for constraining the randomization of Inputs, sampling the signals to check for the functional coverage and to compare the output signals with a refrence model, and monitoring the signals to know the details about a failed operation. The UVM was used in this project as it offers alot of advantages due to it's properties such as:Structured and Reusable Testbench, Scalability, Improved Debugging and Reporting, Layered Architecture for Separation of Concerns, Industry Standard and Ecosystem Support, Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) and Standardization and Collaboration.
In summary, Incorporating UVM into Verilog verification introduces a powerful, scalable, and reusable methodology. It helps streamline the process, improves test coverage, and ensures better documentation and debug support.
